# React Laboratory

A minimal boilerplate required to test and experiment with React. 

*Note: this should not be used in production. For test only.*

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tstringer/react-laboratory.git
$ cd react-laboratory
$ npm install
```

## Run the dev server (webpack-dev-server)

```
$ npm run
```

Open your browser to http://localhost:8080 to view.  Modify your React code in your editor, save your changes, and watch those changes automatically reflect in the browser! *(the power of webpack-dev-server)*
